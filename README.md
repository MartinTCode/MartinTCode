## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a junior developer in training with a strong foundation in Java, SQL and backend development. I’m currently studying Information Systems and Technology Engineering at LTU (Sweden), remotely, in a highly practical and project-oriented program.

Previously, I pursued advanced studies in Computer Engineering and Pedagogy at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, where I completed over 190 ECTS in programming, databases, computer architecture, security, and discrete mathematics among other courses.

My background combines solid technical skills with professional experience in demanding environments, such as high-security monitoring and technical teaching. I’m looking to grow professionally in the IT sector and contribute from day one as part of a development team.
