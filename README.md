## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a junior developer in training with a strong foundation in Java, SQL and backend development. I’m currently studying Information Systems and Technology Engineering at LTU (Sweden), remotely, in a highly practical and project-oriented program.

Previously, I pursued advanced studies in Computer Engineering and Pedagogy at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, where I completed over 190 ECTS in programming, databases, computer architecture, security, and discrete mathematics.

My background combines solid technical skills with professional experience in demanding environments, such as high-security monitoring and technical teaching. I’m looking to grow professionally in the IT sector and contribute from day one as part of a development team.
